# How to Get Unbanned on Blades of Fire (2025 Guide) ⚔️🔥

Getting banned from Blades of Fire can feel like your sword just broke mid-battle—super frustrating, especially if you think the ban was totally unfair. Don’t sweat it! This quick and friendly guide will walk you through what to do if your Blades of Fire account is banned and how to appeal for the best shot at getting back to slashing.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban pop up right after making a fresh account? Or are all your accounts mysteriously locked out? You could be facing an **HWID ban** (Hardware ID Ban)! Basically, Blades of Fire spotted your PC’s unique ID and decided you’re on the naughty list, no matter how many new accounts you try.
